About

OkCutepic is a new dating app created by Ariel Herman and Matt Crowe.  Using the app, users can match with each other based on a Tinder-like swipe feature that displays only the picture of the other users, or use the search feature to view the interests and bio of other users, with no picture available.  

Features

1. Sign Up
-New user can sign up for an account by completing a form including username, password, and a collection of profile attributes for other users to see
-Users can choose from a pre-seeded list of 20 interests, or choose to create as many of their own as they would like, which will be available as an option for any users signing up in the future
-Username and Password will be used to authenticate the user and ensure that their matches will still be shown after logging out and back in

2. Search by Interests
-Users can search based on interest through a collection of other users that renders on the page matching the current user's gender preference
-The other users will be rendered with an avatar they choose when signing, their interests, gender, and bio, but no picture of themselves
-The search will continuously filter the rendered users with every letter typed in the search bar
-The user will be able to "like" other users by clicking the like button.  A mutual match will be created if the liked user also liked the current user
-Users can also filter rendered users by clicking the "shared interest only" checkbox. This will only show other users who have at least 1 shared interest with the current user

3. Swipe
-Users can switch to the swipe tab and see one other user rendered at a time of the current user's preferred gender
-The other users will be rendered with only a picture of themselves and no additional information
-Users can choose to "like" or "thumbs down" the rendered user.  Liking the user will create a match and a mutual match will be created if the liked user also liked the current user.  Clicking thumbs down move on to the next rendered user.

4. Matches
-Users can switch to the matches tab to see the users that they have any mutual matches with.
-Matches will display a picture, gender sign, interests, and bio
